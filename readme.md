# poe-try tries to generate "poetry" inspired by the works of Poe

poe-try is a fun project for Procjam 2018, which has a theme of "poetry".
[http://poe-try.alexanderpendleton.com](http://poe-try.alexanderpendleton.com "See it live on the internet") Its behavior works "best" on desktop browsers. It does some silly (but interesting!) things on mobile.

If you want to use this, feel free! It's not a professional product, but I'll help out if I can. :)
